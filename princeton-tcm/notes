	<h3>Investment Philosophy</h3>
            <p class="pad-top">Our primary investment objective is to learn about investing. In pursuit of this 
            objective, we maintain a concentrated portfolio of small and mid cap companies, 
            which enables us to gain an edge and have a deep understanding of all our 
            holdings.</p><br>

            <h3>Investment Process</h3>
            <p class="pad-top">We take advantage of our academic background and our distance from Wall 
            Street noise to take a research-intensive approach to investing. Our fund sources 
            its ideas from six internal research groups, Global, Industrials, Consumer, Energy, 
            Healthcare, and Technology, led by the fundâ€™s partners. Each investment idea 
            undergoes a rigorous two-stage process that includes an initial pitch and 
            investment note, followed by a discussion of entry/exit strategy.</p><br>
